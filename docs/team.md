# The Macondo Team

[Back to Main Page](/macondo)

## César Del Solar, software architect

César basically wrote the software for this. He likes writing software and does it for a living as well. When he's not writing software, he likes biking, playing music, and frying up some chicken thighs. He also likes playing Scrabble, although nowadays, it kind of plays him instead.

Insert picture here lol

## Jesse Day, data scientist

Jesse does the hard data science for this, doing data analysis on millions of completed games, helping to come up with parameter values, some complex algorithms, and the machine learning component. He has finished runner-up at the World Scrabble Championship twice, and is the North American Scrabble Champion (in the Collins lexicon, I am obligated to add).

## Conrad Bassett-Bouchard, UX designer

Conrad is designing the user interface / experience for Macondo and its sister project, The Crossword Game Club (or whatever we end up calling it). He does UX design for a living at Google, and is a former National Scrabble Champion.
