# What is a crossword board game?

A crossword board game is a board game where you take turns creating crosswords
with one or more players. Some examples are:

- Scrabble™️ Brand Crossword Game
- Words with Friends
- Lexulous
- Yahoo! Literati (defunct)

# How to use Macondo:

See the manual and information here:

https://domino14.github.io/macondo

# protoc

To generate pb files, run this in the macondo directory:

`protoc --go_out=gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative ./api/proto/macondo/macondo.proto`

Make sure you have done

`go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest`

# Creating a new release

(Notes mostly for myself)

Tag the release; i.e. `git tag vX.Y.Z`, then `git push --tags`. This will kick off a github action that builds and uploads the latest binaries. Then you should generate some release notes manually.

### UCGI

Macondo can talk UCGI.

See https://github.com/woogles-io/open-protocols/blob/main/ucgi/ucgi.md

The above document is very subject to change and is not accurate. This codebase and
https://github.com/jvc56/MAGPIE should be considered reference implementations.
If there is a difference between these and the documentation, refer to the code.
We will update the document as it evolves. We will strive to keep MAGPIE and Macondo
100% compatible with each other.

The UCGI CLI is at cmd/ucgi_cli
