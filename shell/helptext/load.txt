load - Load a game from GCG or CGP

Example usage:

    load /Users/cesar/vs_jesse.gcg
    load ~/Downloads/game2.gcg

You can also use a cross-tables game ID and it will correctly load
the game:

    load xt 19009

The above will load the cross-tables game located at
https://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=19009

If you want to load a .gcg file from the web, you can just do:

    load web https://example.com/mygame.gcg

You can use a Woogles game ID and it will load the game from https://woogles.io
as well:

    load woogles RSwBsyCj

If you would like to load a CGP file, use it as follows:

    load cgp 15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15/15 AELNOQT/ 0/0 0 lex NWL18; lm -2;

(See https://github.com/domino14/macondo/tree/master/cgp#readme for an explanation
of the CGP file format).

This command will load a game into memory. You can then step through the
game with the `n`, `b`, and `turn` commands, generate plays, simulate,
solve endgames, and more.
