load - Load a GCG from disk or cross-tables.com

Example usage:

    load /Users/cesar/vs_jesse.gcg

You can also use a cross-tables game ID and it will correctly load
the game:

    load xt 19009

The above will load the cross-tables game located at
https://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=19009

This command will load a game into memory. You can then step through the
game with the `n`, `b`, and `turn` commands, generate plays, simulate,
solve endgames, and more.
