analyze-batch [options] <source1> [source2] ... - Analyze multiple games

Example:
    analyze-batch woog:ABC123 woog:DEF456
    analyze-batch xt:12345 xt:67890
    analyze-batch /path/to/game1.gcg /path/to/game2.gcg
    analyze-batch woog:ABC xt:123 /path/game.gcg
    analyze-batch -player "nickname" woog:ABC woog:DEF
    analyze-batch -summary-only woog:ABC woog:DEF
    analyze-batch woogcollection:UUID-OF-COLLECTION

This command analyzes multiple games from various sources and displays per-game
analysis tables plus an aggregated summary. It supports loading games from:

  - Woogles: Use format "woog:GAMEID"
  - Woogles Collection: Use format "woogcollection:UUID" (fetches all games in collection)
  - Cross-tables: Use format "xt:GAMEID"
  - Local GCG files: Use file path (e.g., "/path/to/game.gcg")
  - Web URLs: Use full HTTP/HTTPS URL

Each game is analyzed using the same phase-appropriate analysis as the `analyze`
command:
  - Early/mid game (>7 tiles in bag): Monte Carlo simulation
  - Early pre-endgame (2-7 tiles in bag): More thorough simulation
  - Pre-endgame (1 tile in bag): PEG solver
  - Endgame (0 tiles in bag): Negamax solver

Options:

    -player 0

    Analyze only moves by player 0 (the first player) in all games.

    -player 1

    Analyze only moves by player 1 (the second player) in all games.

    -player "nickname"

    Analyze only moves by the player with the specified nickname across all
    games. The nickname must match exactly (case-sensitive).

    -continue

    Continue processing remaining games even if one fails to load or analyze.
    By default, the command stops on the first error.

    -summary-only

    Only show the batch summary table. Skip the per-game analysis tables.
    This is useful when analyzing many games and you only care about the
    aggregated statistics.

Output:

Without -summary-only, the command shows:
  1. Per-game analysis table (same format as `analyze` command)
  2. Batch summary table at the end

The batch summary includes:
  - Per-game results showing each player's Mistake Index and mistake breakdown
  - Aggregate statistics by player across all games:
    * Total games played
    * Total turns played
    * Total optimal moves
    * Breakdown of small/medium/large mistakes
    * Average Mistake Index
    * Estimated ELO (based on average MI)

Mistake Index:

0.2 pts for a small mistake, 0.5 pts for a medium mistake, 1.0 pts for a
large mistake. The batch analysis shows both per-game MI and average MI
across all games for each player.
