autoplay [options] - computer vs computer games

Example:

    autoplay
    autoplay stop
    autoplay -logfile /path/to/log.txt
    autoplay exhaustiveleave noleave -logfile foo.txt -leavefile1 trial.idx

Options:
    -logfile foo.txt   -- logs games to foo.txt
    -lexicon CSW19  -- uses the CSW19 lexicon
    -letterdistribution norwegian  -- uses the Norwegian letter distribution.
        (you should probably set the lexicon option to be that of a Norwegian
        gaddag name as well)

    -leavefile1 filename.idx
    -leavefile2 filename.idx

    The two options above will use leavefile1 for player1 and leavefile2
    for player2. Note that leave files only make sense for the `exhaustiveleave`
    players.

    -pegfile1 pegfile.json
    -pegfile2 pegfile.json

    pegfile refers to a pre-endgame heuristics file used for equity purposes.
    By default, it uses a file named preendgame.json.

    The leavefile and/or pegfile must be located inside the
    ./data/strategy/<lexicon> directory.
    Make sure to put it in the subdirectory for the correct lexicon.
    By default, if no file is specified, will use the default leave file
    for your DEFAULT_LEXICON (or the supplied lexicon).

    -botcode1 BOT_CODE
    -botcode2 BOT_CODE

    Uses specific bot types / strategies. Defaults to HASTY_BOT if not provided,
    which is a raw equity player. Types can be taken from the macondo.proto file.
    So far, these are:
    - HASTY_BOT,
    - LEVEL1_CEL_BOT through LEVEL4_CEL_BOT (Common English Lexicon),
    - LEVEL1_PROBABILISTIC through LEVEL5_PROBABILISTIC.

autoplay can be used to generate computer vs computer games for research
purposes.

To stop autoplay, type `autoplay stop`. If no log file is specified,
it will default to `/tmp/autoplay.txt`, otherwise, use the desired
filename as an option.

By default, autoplay will use two identical, fast AI players of type
'exhaustiveleave'. An 'exhaustiveleave' player uses values for all possible
leaves that must already be in the data/strategy directory. If you don't have
any values or wish to try with no values, you can use the 'noleave' player.

In the future, we will add other types of players.
