infer [options] - Perform a tile inference

Example:
    infer
    infer -threads 3
    infer details
    infer log

Inference requires a game to be loaded. It tries to infer what tiles the
last person to make a move kept.

Note that it uses Monte Carlo simulation in order to do the inference, and it
goes "two levels deep". So it should be more accurate than it was in the past,
but definitely significantly slower.

The only allowed move types for inference at this moment are "exchange" and
"tile play". That is, the last move must be an exchange or a tile play in
order for inference to work.

Inference will return an error if the move was not one of these two types,
or if there was no previous move. If the bag was empty when the player
made the move, it also does not bother inferring.

In order to set the rack of the player who is performing the inference,
so that the player whose rack is being inferred doesn't get assigned this
rack, just set it in the game using the "rack" option.

When the inferrer is done running, it prints out stats for the tiles.

Inferences are saved in memory. You can sim using these inferences.
See `help sim` or do `sim -useinferences weightedrandom`.

Note: Sometimes the inference engine will display "No inference details". It
is not broken; it was unable to find racks where the opponent's play ranked
highly enough for it to be able to infer anything.

Optional arguments:
    `infer log` will log to a temporary file.

    `infer details` shows a bit more details about the inference, including
    per-tile counts.

Options:

    -threads 3

    More threads means a more accurate inference. If not set, this number
    defaults to the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

    -time 60

    The amount of time in seconds to infer. Defaults to 60 seconds. You may
    want this to be a little bit larger on slower machines / those with
    fewer cores.
