script [filepath] - Execute the Lua script in the file path.

Macondo is scriptable; many of the shell commands can be run directly
with Lua 5.1 scripts.

The following commands are currently supported by Lua:

    - gen
    - load

To invoke the command with Lua, prefix it with the macondo_ namespace.
For example, macondo_gen and macondo_load.

The commands take in a single string with all of its arguments. For example,
you can call load as such:

    macondo_load('xt 19009')         -- load the cross-tables game 19009

See the scripts directory in the main Macondo repo for some sample Lua scripts.
