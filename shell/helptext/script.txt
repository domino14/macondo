script [filepath] - Execute the Lua script in the file path.

Macondo is scriptable; many of the shell commands can be run directly
with Lua 5.1 scripts.

The following commands are currently supported by Lua:

    - gen
    - load

To invoke the command with Lua, prefix it with the macondo_ namespace.
For example, macondo_gen and macondo_load.
