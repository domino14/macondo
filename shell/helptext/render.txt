render - Render the current board position in 3D

Example usage:

    render
    render -tile-color pink -board-color blue
    render -tile-color black
    render -heatmap "H8 HELLO"
    render -heatmap "12A JOINT" -ply 0
    render -heatmap "12A JOINT" -ply 1

This command generates a 3D visualization of the current board position using
Three.js and opens it in your default web browser. The visualization includes:

- Interactive 3D board with tiles
- Your rack on an angled stand
- Unseen tiles (bag + opponent's rack) displayed to the right
- Bonus squares (double/triple word/letter)
- Row and column labels
- Mouse controls: drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
- Save button to export the view as PNG

Options:
    -tile-color    Color of the tiles (default: orange)
                   Options: orange, yellow, pink, red, blue, black, white
    -board-color   Color of the board base (default: jade)
                   Options: jade, teal, blue, purple, green, darkgreen, brown
    -heatmap       Render heatmap overlay for a specific play (requires simulation data)
                   Example: -heatmap "H8 HELLO"
                   Must run 'sim -collect-heatmap true' first to generate heatmap data
                   Shows blue (low) to red (high) gradient for tile placement frequency
                   The move will be temporarily placed on the board in the visualization
                   Board colors are automatically dimmed when heatmap is active
    -ply           Ply index to analyze (default: 0, meaning opponent's immediate response)
                   Example: -ply 0 (opponent's response), -ply 1 (your follow-up), etc.
                   Only valid when used with -heatmap

The rendered HTML file is saved to a temporary location (typically /tmp) and
automatically opened. The file will persist until your system cleans up temp
files, so you can revisit it or share it.

You must have a game loaded first. Use the `load` command to load a game.
