turn <n> - Skip to turn <n> in a game.

Examples:
    turn 3
    turn 25

You must have a game loaded into memory with the `load` command or similar.

A turn is equivalent to an event. It is not necessarily what we think of when
we think of a turn. For example, if a player makes a play, and it's then challenged
off, each of those is an event, and they would have consecutive turn numbers.
