sim [args] [options] - Start or stop a Monte Carlo simulation

Example:
    sim
    sim -plies 3
    sim -plies 3 -stop 95
    sim -plies 3 -threads 3
    sim continue
    sim stop
    sim show
    sim details
    sim log
    sim trim 3
    sim -opprack AENST

A list of plays must have been generated or added in another way already.

Optional arguments:

    Use `stop` to stop a running simulation, `show` to show the plays ranked
    by equity so far, and `details` to see more per-ply details of each play.

    Sim `continue` will continue a previously stopped simulation from where
    it left off. You can `stop` a simulation, delete plays with the `trim`
    command, and restart the simulation this way if you wish it to be faster.

    Sim `trim` takes in a numerical argument: the number of plays to remove
    from the BOTTOM of the sorted play list. So, for example, `sim trim 5`
    will remove the bottom 5 plays. You may want to run this after simulating
    for some number of iterations.

    Before starting a simulation, you can also do `sim log` to write the log
    to a temporary file.


Options:

    -plies 3

    The above option will use 3 plies of look-ahead. By default, Macondo
    uses 2 plies.

    -threads 3

    The above option sets the number of threads that Macondo uses to sim
    your game (3 in this example). If not set, this number defaults to
    the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

    -stop 95

    You can use a number between 80 and 99.99 for this parameter.
    This makes the sim stop when it is X percent sure that the top move is
    the winning move.

    Note: using this option will stop the simulation after a fixed number of
    plies (usually a few thousand). It's possible to get to 5000+ plies without having
    a clear winner, but this usually means the winning plays are pretty similar.

    -scond 95

    scond is an alias for stop

    -opprack AENST

    You can specify the opponent's rack (or partial rack) if you know it, for a
    more accurate sim. Use ? for blanks.

    -useinferences cycle

    You can use automatic inferences while simming. You must have run the
    `infer` command prior to using this. The different options are:
        cycle - cycle through inferences indefinitely
        random - pick a random rack from the inferences each time

    Note: the opprack option is not compatible with this. If you use both,
    it will ignore the opprack.

    -it 10000

    Sim for just this many iterations. Macondo may stop slightly after.

    -pfreq 100

    Print out the current stats every 100 iterations, in UCGI output format.
    By default, this is off.

    -cfreq 500

    Check for the stopping condition every 500 iterations.
