sim [args] [options] - Start or stop a Monte Carlo simulation

Example:
    sim
    sim -plies 3
    sim -plies 3 -stop 95
    sim -plies 3 -threads 3
    sim continue
    sim stop
    sim show
    sim details
    sim log
    sim trim 3
    sim -opprack AENST
    sim -collect-heatmap true
    sim heatmap "F3 BAR" 0
    sim playstats "H3 FOO"
    sim tilestats
    sim -useinferences weightedrandomracks

A list of plays must have been generated or added in another way already.

Optional arguments:

    Use `stop` to stop a running simulation, `show` to show the plays ranked
    by equity so far, and `details` to see more per-ply details of each play.

    Sim `continue` will continue a previously stopped simulation from where
    it left off. You can `stop` a simulation, delete plays with the `trim`
    command, and restart the simulation this way if you wish it to be faster.

    Sim `trim` takes in a numerical argument: the number of plays to remove
    from the BOTTOM of the sorted play list. So, for example, `sim trim 5`
    will remove the bottom 5 plays. You may want to run this after simulating
    for some number of iterations.

    Before starting a simulation, you can also do `sim log` to write the log
    to a temporary file.

    Use `heatmap` as an argument to display a heatmap of the last sim for a
    particular play.
    You must have set the `-collect-heatmap` option to `true` in order to do this.
    This argument also requires two additional arguments: the play, and the
    ply index (starting at 0). For example:

    sim heatmap "H3 FOO" 0

    A ply index of 0 corresponds to your opponent's response. If a ply index is
    not provided, it defaults to 0. Ply index of 1 is your next move after
    your opponent's response, and so on.

    sim playstats "H3 FOO" shows detailed stats for a specific play. This play
    must have been simmed, and the `-collect-heatmap` option must have been set to
    `true`.

    sim playstats "H3 FOO" histogram -- this additionally shows a histogram of score
    distributions for the next two plies.

    sim tilestats shows stats about your opponent's tiles - what the percentage
    chance is of them having a certain tile. It doesn't use inference for this,
    just Monte Carlo, at this time. See `help infer` if you would like to use
    inference instead.

Options:

    -plies 3

    The above option will use 3 plies of look-ahead. By default, Macondo
    uses 2 plies.

    -threads 3

    The above option sets the number of threads that Macondo uses to sim
    your game (3 in this example). If not set, this number defaults to
    the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

    -stop 95

    You can use 95, 98, or 99 for this option. This makes the sim stop when it is
    X percent sure that the top move is the winning move.

    Note: using this option will stop the simulation after a fixed number of
    plies (usually 5000). It's possible to get to 5000 plies without having
    a clear winner, but this usually means the winning plays are pretty similar.

    -opprack AENST

    You can specify the opponent's rack (or partial rack) if you know it, for a
    more accurate sim. Use ? for blanks.

    -useinferences weightedrandomracks

    You can use automatic inferences while simming. You must have run the
    `infer` command prior to using this. There are two options for inference
    mode:

        weightedrandomtiles:
            Inference returns a number of racks with a "weight" attached to them.
            This mode computes a tile distribution based on all of the racks
            and randomly draws from this distribution for the opponent's
            inferred rack.,

        weightedrandomracks:
            This simpler mode just draws the racks themselves with the given
            weights. It does not draw tile-by-tile. This mode might perform better.

    Note: the opprack option is not compatible with this. If you use both,
    it will ignore the opprack.

    -collect-heatmap true

    You can collect a heatmap of a sim if you set this option to true. If you
    do this, make sure to *not* use the sim log command prior. Otherwise,
    the heatmap will not be collected.

    Note that collecting a heatmap has a small performance impact on the sim speed.

    After your sim stops, you can visualize the heatmap and stats of the
    different plays you simmed. Use `sim heatmap` for this. Refer to the beginning
    of this document for more information on the parameters for `sim heatmap`.

    -avoid-prune "F5 FOO"

    If you are cutting off plays, any plays you specify with potentially repeated
    `-avoid-prune` options never get cut off. This is good for comparing plays you
    made to the top plays.
