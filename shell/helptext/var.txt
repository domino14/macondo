var - Manage variations (alternative lines of play)

Example usage:

    var                    List all variations from the current branching point
    var list              Same as above
    var main              Switch to the main line
    var 1                 Switch to variation 1
    var info              Show current variation info
    var delete 1          Delete variation 1
    var promote 1         Promote variation 1 to become the main line

The variation system lets you explore different lines of play from the same
position, similar to chess engine analysis. When you commit a move at a
historical position (after using 'p' or 'turn' to go back), a new variation
is automatically created.

Variations are stored in-memory only and are cleared when you load a new game
or exit the shell. The main line is never truncated when creating variations.

When you switch to a variation, you land at the branching point (the first
move that differs). Use 'n' to step through the continuation moves in that
variation. Use 'p' to go back.

The 'promote' command lets you swap a variation with the main line. This is
useful when you discover that a variation is actually the correct line and
want it to become the main line when exporting to GCG.

The current variation is displayed at the bottom of the board when using the
'show' command.
