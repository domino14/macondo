volunteer - Donate your computer's processing power to analyze Woogles games

Usage:
    volunteer           Start volunteer mode (begin polling for jobs)
    volunteer stop      Stop polling after current job completes

Before volunteering:
    1. Set your Woogles API key: setconfig woogles-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
    2. Unload any active game: unload
    3. Run speedtest to check your computer: speedtest

While volunteering:
    - Your computer will poll for analysis jobs every 30 seconds
    - When a job is found, Macondo will analyze the game automatically
    - Polling pauses during analysis and resumes when complete
    - Avoid running other computationally heavy tasks

To stop:
    - Use `volunteer stop` to finish current job and stop gracefully
    - Only quit the shell directly if you absolutely must
    - Quitting mid-job may cause the job to be reassigned to another volunteer
