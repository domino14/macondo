analyze [options] - Analyze every move in a loaded game

Example:
    analyze
    analyze -player 0
    analyze -player "nickname"

This command analyzes every move in the currently loaded game, comparing the
played move to the optimal move using phase-appropriate analysis:
  - Early/mid game (>7 tiles in bag): Monte Carlo simulation
  - Early pre-endgame (2-7 tiles in bag): More thorough simulation
  - Pre-endgame (1 tile in bag): PEG solver
  - Endgame (0 tiles in bag): Negamax solver

The analysis shows:
  - The move that was played vs the optimal move
  - Win probability loss (or spread loss in endgame)
  - Phony detection and missed challenges
  - Per-player accuracy statistics

Note: This command requires a game to be loaded. Use `load` to load a GCG file
or `load woogles <game-id>` to load a game from Woogles.

Options:

    -player 0

    Analyze only moves by player 0 (the first player). This can speed up
    analysis if you're only interested in one player's performance.

    -player 1

    Analyze only moves by player 1 (the second player).

    -player "nickname"

    Analyze only moves by the player with the specified nickname. The nickname
    must match exactly (case-sensitive).

Output:

The command produces a table showing:
  - Turn number
  - Player name
  - Rack
  - Played move
  - Optimal move
  - Win% loss (or spread loss in endgame)
  - Game phase (Early, EarlyPE, PEG, or Endgame)
  - Notes (phony warnings, missed challenges, etc.)

Followed by a summary table showing per-player statistics:
  - Total turns played
  - Number of optimal moves
  - Average win% loss
  - Average spread loss
  - Mistake Index

The analysis automatically detects phonies by checking words against the
lexicon and flags unchallenged phonies and missed challenges.

Mistake Index:

0.2 pts for a small mistake, 0.5 pts for a medium mistake, 1.0 pts for a
large mistake.
