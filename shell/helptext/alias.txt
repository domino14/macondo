alias - Create command shortcuts for frequently used commands

Usage:

    alias                     List all defined aliases
    alias list                List all defined aliases
    alias set <name> <cmd>    Create a new alias
    alias show <name>         Display what an alias expands to
    alias delete <name>       Remove an alias

Examples:

    alias set simdeep sim -plies 5 -stop 99
    alias set quick gen 25
    alias show simdeep
    alias delete quick

Aliases are stored in your config file (~/.config/macondo/config.yaml) and
persist across sessions. When you use an alias, any additional arguments or
options you provide are appended to the expanded command.

For example, if you define:
    alias set simdeep sim -plies 5 -stop 99

Then running:
    simdeep -threads 4

Expands to:
    sim -plies 5 -stop 99 -threads 4

Aliases support chaining - an alias can call another alias. The shell will
recursively expand aliases up to a depth of 10 to prevent infinite loops.
