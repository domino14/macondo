gen - Generate moves and sort by equity

Example usage:

    gen
    gen 25
    gen -numplays 25

If no argument is provided, it defaults to generating 15 plays. This
command will generate plays and sort them by equity, replacing the
current list of moves. You can view this list at any time with the
`list` command.

You must have a game already loaded. After generating, you can use the
`sim` command to start a simulation.

`gen -numplays X` is equivalent to `gen X`.
