explain [options] - Generate AI explanation for the current position

  Uses AI (Gemini, OpenAI, or DeepSeek) to provide detailed explanations of the best plays
  in the current position. The AI analyzes simulation results and provides
  insights about tile leaves, strategic considerations, and play selection.

  Requirements:
  - A game must be loaded or created
  - At least 9 unseen tiles (not available in endgame positions)
  - AI provider configured (see `help setconfig` for setup)

  Options:
    -plies <n>      Number of simulation plies (default: 5)
    -opprack <rack> Set opponent's rack for simulation
    -stop <n>       Stop simulation at n% confidence level (default: 99)

  Examples
      explain
      explain -plies 3 -stop 95
      explain -opprack AEINRST
      explain -plies 4 -stop 95 -opprack TESTING

  The command will:
  1. Generate top moves if not already done
  2. Run Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate positions (stops at 99% confidence)
  3. Send results to AI for detailed analysis
  4. Return comprehensive explanation with strategic insights

  Configuration:
  Use `setconfig` to configure AI settings:
  - setconfig genai-provider gemini     (or openai, or deepseek)
  - setconfig gemini-api-key <key>      (or openai-api-key, or deepseek-api-key)
  - setconfig gemini-model <model>      (or openai-model, or deepseek-model)

  See `help setconfig` for more configuration options.
